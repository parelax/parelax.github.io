            <p>
                Parelax is a standalone application that allows you to play local multiplayer games online with friends. It's easy to use, and you can

                Parelax will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. We're also working on a mobile version for Android and iOS, so you can play
                your favorite local multiplayer games on the go!

            <h2>Q. Is this Parsec?</h2>
            <p>
                No, Parelax is not Parsec. Parelax is it's own thing, completely separate from Parsec. We're not affiliated with Parsec in any way.
                You will not need to use Parsec Soda for hosting, and will have lots of other features that Parsec doesn't have.
